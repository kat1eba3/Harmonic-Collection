     <h1>Commuting: Reimagined</h1>
   </body>
 </html><p>My theme for the harmonic collection focuses on my daily commute to school. Commuting is a big part of my school year, as I spend quite some time sitting on the bus and the train. The task of commuting quickly becomes mundane with the same scenery and route day after day. A big part of my commute involves music, as it helps going from place to place become less boring and, at times, more exciting. I want my theme to combine commuting and music to illustrate a romanticized, fun, and fictional take on my daily commute. For each entry, I want to pick a song and retell the story of my daily commute through the tone and feelings the song conveys. For this reimagined version of commuting, I want to do a comic-panel style layout and incorporate mixed media art composed of photographs of the places I sit, walk, and see as I head to school or home, combining it with my own illustrations to show the reimagined parts inspired by the song of choice. In each of these comic panels, I plan on telling different stories, each inspired by the different song of the day.</p>
